# Stage 2 – PJM Supply Increase (Draft)

- Mint amount: **100,000,000 PJM** (to rewards/vesting contract)
- Additional USDC liquidity: **0** (USDC cap already used in Stage 1)
- Triggers: DAU ≥ 50,000 OR daily DEX volume ≥ $50,000; LP share ≥1% of circulating PJM; price drawdown <20% vs pre-stage; circulation cap before execution ≤60M PJM.
- Execution: Anchor/DAO proposal; multisig 3/5 (or DAO majority); log all tx hashes in `Reports/full_history.md` and registry.
- Post-mint: monitor LP share; rebalance CLMM if needed; keep emissions paced to maintain LP ≥1% circ.
